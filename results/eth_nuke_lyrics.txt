 a man who is unlucky enough to be spotted may hear his name inserted in the songs he will then be obliged for the sake of prestige to pay for the honour the price being commensurate with his social status and the enthusiasm with which the women sing his name the occasion is seized upon by women to sing the praises of any men who in their view are good husbands and to scold not to say insult the bad inconsiderate husband who behaves as if women were married to be made slaves of or drinks too much or is too lazy to work the following song is typical osee yei yee yei REJOICE REJOICE AKOSUA A UNAVAILABLE FIRI BOADI AKOSUA WHO HAILS FROM BOADI NA UNAVAILABLE SE S AWADE A SHE SAYS THAT THE MARRIAGE INTO WHICH UNAVAILABLE K UNAVAILABLE E YI S SII NO YIE SHE ENTERED WHETHER IT CAME OFF WELL S ANSI NO YIE OR DID NOT COME OFF WELL ENE NO NK NT N HUNU THERE IS HER EMPTY BASKET MESO NK NT N HUNU I AM CARRYING AN EMPTY BASKET NA WOREHWEHW MU AND YOU ARE SEARCHING THROUGH IT OHIA A WONHUNUU BI DA YOU PITILESS PERSON MESO NK NT N HUNU I AM CARRYING AN EMPTY BASKET NA WOREHWEHW MU AND YOU ARE SEARCHING THROUGH IT ME NE M'AWADE B UNAVAILABLE NE ME AND MY DISASTROUS MARRIAGE MESO NK NT N HUNU I AM CARRYING AN EMPTY BASKET NA WOREHWEHW MU AND YOU ARE SEARCHING THROUGH IT if the initiand is betrothed the fianc may be glorified in this way osee yei yee yei REJOICE REJOICE Y DE MMAA AKOGYINA KUROTIA WOMEN ARE ASSEMBLED AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE UNAVAILABLE HENE NE HWAN WHO IS KING AGYA TAWIA OUR FATHER TAWIA unavailable d unavailable k unavailable ne mu oo love has filled him entirely many are favourite nubility chants which make blunt almost obscene allusions to sex and love here are two osee yei yee yei rejoice rejoice tw adwoa ei VAGINA OF ADWOA NAME OF A GIRL BORN ON A MONDAY OBI DI WO NA IF SOMEONE EATS YOU HAS INTERCOURSE WITH YOU WAMMA WO ADE A AND FAILS TO REWARD YOU KU NO OO SLAY HIM osee yei yee yei REJOICE REJOICE ATA KWASI ADWOA EI ATA KWASI ADWOA A PERSON'S NAME OTOO TOO TO GOOD FOR NOTHING Y REP K UNAVAILABLE TE AT UNAVAILABLE OO WE ARE IN SEARCH OF PENIS TO BUY S MMARIMA NNI KURO YI MU LITTLE REALIZING THAT THIS VILLAGE IS DEVOID OF MEN A JIBE LIKE most other ashanti songs nubility chants are a combination of a few refrains and choruses which are sung several times over rendering them somewhat wearisome there are usually famous soloists who begin each song and keep singing the verses while the rest join in with the choruses

LYRICS:
 when a father dies another lives they say but that is just to delude the orphan a father's body is interred and soon the orphan loses his place of sleep it becomes rare a sleeping place becomes rare 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 an akan popular song mourns the plight of an orphan and draws attention to the divergence between the akan aphorism agya bi wu a agya bi te ase when a father dies another lives often cited by sympathizers to console an orphan and the social reality whereby orphans are neglected by successors to their fathers' estates part of the song runs WHEN A FATHER DIES ANOTHER LIVES THEY SAY BUT THAT IS JUST TO DELUDE THE ORPHAN A FATHER'S BODY IS INTERRED AND SOON THE ORPHAN LOSES HIS PLACE OF SLEEP IT BECOMES RARE A SLEEPING PLACE BECOMES RARE this song is basically a critique of the akan matrilineal system of inheritance whereby an orphan may lose his dead father's estate to his father's matrilineal relations but the singer does not only attack the matrilineal system he indulges in oral literary criticism exposing the oft cited consolatory proverb as mere rhetoric

LYRICS:
 when the hawk leaves to lay eggs she makes kite the caretaker grandchild of the warrior that seizes rivers yirifi ankamago grandchild of the town despoiler that owns the talking drums father i am done for alas father i am finished alas it's me calling you like the rainbow inviting the morning rain alas grandchild of akuwa that hails from papawase alas grandchild of ansa the blood drinker grandchild of the valiant one father the father of children the small mpataa fish can also be arrogant because it lives in the big river 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 in the following dirge sung for my recording in akwamu an attributive proverb begins and ends the stanza WHEN THE HAWK LEAVES TO LAY EGGS SHE MAKES KITE THE CARETAKER GRANDCHILD OF THE WARRIOR THAT SEIZES RIVERS YIRIFI ANKAMAGO GRANDCHILD OF THE TOWN DESPOILER THAT OWNS THE TALKING DRUMS FATHER I AM DONE FOR ALAS FATHER I AM FINISHED ALAS IT'S ME CALLING YOU LIKE THE RAINBOW INVITING THE MORNING RAIN ALAS GRANDCHILD OF AKUWA THAT HAILS FROM PAPAWASE ALAS GRANDCHILD OF ANSA THE BLOOD DRINKER GRANDCHILD OF THE VALIANT ONE FATHER THE FATHER OF CHILDREN THE SMALL MPATAA FISH CAN ALSO BE ARROGANT BECAUSE IT LIVES IN THE BIG RIVER in this dirge the singer mourns the death of a relative in whose absence she is at a loss yet she employs two proverbs to make subtle reference to alternative sources of hope and pride she is at a loss yet she belongs to a lineage whose members take care of other needy children like their own the sources of protection in this dirge are metaphorically the kite and the great river it is realized that while the singer repetitively chants the genealogy of the deceased's ancestry and emphasizes her loss her sources of future support and protection are subdued and muted in condensed proverbial terms since the dirge after all is ostensibly a lament not a song of joy and hope

ETHNOGRAPHY:

 some information on the meaning of these ilyin can be gained from a comparative study of the ritual songs there are certain typical elements in the verses which accompany the several rites a recurring figure of the rituals consists in running on all fours like a dog and then running between the legs of the other performer 35 when they perform this they sing the following text NGOA GHOST NGOALPANA LIKE A GHOST KILILIN LYANPA KILILINPANA MY LYANPA WANKANA RAW TALIN PUNGANA RED the adjectives raw and red refer to the sticks dipped in blood in one case however we have a slightly different version and a different translation kalumba penis litaranganu DRAGGING KILILIN LYANPA KILILINPANA MY LYANPA WANKANA RAW TALINPUNGANA SHINING RED in this case raw and red as adjectives refer to the subincision wound we might therefore regard the blood stained crescent shaped arrangement as a decoration that represents the subincision hole while the little sticks dipped in blood may represent the penis

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 late at night an emu ceremony was performed and the whole evening was occupied until midnight in singing by the parra the old men as before sitting in the midst of a large circle of young men all being huddled close together on occasions such as this the singing is always a monotonous repetition of a few phrases such as THE SAND HILLS ARE GOOD THE ACHILPA WALKED IN THE ALCHERA TO THERIERITA BIND THE NURTUNJA ROUND WITH RINGS AND RINGS and so on and it is wonderful to see for how many hours they will continue without apparently their spirits flagging or their voices becoming husky

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the most popular bloco afro in recent years is olodum the most political afro bahian carnival organization olodums breakthrough came in 1987 when they created an homage to ancient egypt in order to show that blacks belonged to one of the earliest and most impressive civilizations on earth their biggest hit for that year was fara divinidade do egito composed by luciano gomes dos santos the first stanza page 17 provides a short poetic outline of egyptian mythology and the second stanza relates the theme back to afro bahia pelourinho uma pequena comunidade que por m olodum unira em laos de confraternidade despertai vos cultura egpcia no brasil em vez de cabelos tranados veremos turbantes de tutanc mon e nas cabeas se enchem de liberdade o povo negro pede igualdade deixando de lado as separa es PELOURINHO A SMALL COMMUNITY THAT EVEN SO OLODUM UNITED IN FRATERNAL TIES AWAKEN EGYPTIAN CULTURE IN BRAZIL INSTEAD OF BRAIDED HAIR WELL SEE TURBANS OF TUTANKAMON AND FILL YOUR HEADS WITH LIBERTY THE BLACK PEOPLE CALL FOR EQUALITY LEAVING BEHIND THE SEPARATIONS fara was novel because it suggested that afro brazilians could affirm their identity without conforming rigidly to the black aesthetic standard first established in the 1970s with il aiy afro bahians could wear braids turbans or whatever and still be racially conscious moura 25 26 in the end the song proclaims that what counts is not the coiffure resting on top of the head but the ideas and attitudes inside the head it was a call to fill your head with liberty and demand racial equality

 in order to cross to the other side you heart must be cleansed and then you will see gods child and you will come in his presence 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 we shall seek to analyse lenshinas teaching in greater depth firstly it will be shown that the prophetess regarded the event of her mission her visionary experience her charter as the central core of her commitment that consisted in teaching people through sacred hymns all her hymns and the report of her charter were rendered in the so called narrative tense that suggests the genre of traditional teaching it will be shown that each hymn possessed one or two symbols around which all other words were arranged lenshina never tired of repeating the sentences that described her visionary experience during which she was given a special mission by the lord the task was a call to repentance expressed by the hymn pa kwabuka kwi shilya IN ORDER TO CROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE KANO MUTIMA WASAMBWA YOU HEART MUST BE CLEANSED UKUYAMONA LESA MWANA ATHEN YOU WILL SEE GODS CHILD UKAFIKA NA KU CINSO AND YOU WILL COME IN HIS PRESENCE this and the other 380 compositions were hardly ever referred to as nyimbo songs hymns tunes lenshina and her people called them mafunde my teaching lulumbi the message good news milumbe choric discourse narratives fables lyashi news bwile mysteries they were more important than any oral teaching in fact the movements sermons were not much more than a meditative expounding of the hymns key message

LYRICS:

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 from her original charter and from the scrutiny of a good number of her hymns it is evident that she sees herself in the role of john the baptist as having been sent back to the world to prepare the second coming of christ lenshina never called herself kasesema a seer a prophet in a great number of hymns she assumes the traditional female role of mediator of go between of intercessor now placed between christ in the east and the people eicho nshikaikala kutali THUS I DO NOT STAY FAR AWAY NDI MUPEPI NE MWINE I LENSHINA AM VERY NEAR NDEPAPATA KULI TATA I IMPLORE THE FATHER BESHIBE MWENGE WABUUTA THAT THEY MAY KNOW THE WHITE TORCH JESU ALEFWAYA KULOFYA JESUS WANTS TO DESTROY MBUTO NKOTE THE OLD SEED NAO JOANI ALEKANA BUT JOHN REFUSES ATI NAPAPATA AND PLEADS this is an allusion to abraham who pleaded with god not to destroy the sinners of sodom and gommorah lenshina as john the baptist pleads with christ not to destroy the people who are behind and do not as yet follow her here it is as if lenshina pleads for inculturation that the new religion of christ should not destroy the old tradition even when it has become archaic but complete it and bring it to perfection the refrain on this important hymn was ba joani mutupe please give us john twangale nabo pe na pe SO THAT WE MAY PLAY WITH HIM HER FOR EVER at times it appeared as if she also assumed the role of john the apostle as the bosom friend of jesus and often the go between of jesus and the apostles

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 while sitting quietly in our tipi we suddenly became aware of a gathering of voices soon followed by a few beats on a large bass drum the camp was about to be entertained by tobacco singers a group of friends who sit before the door of a lodge and sing until the lodge owner offers them a pipe to smoke if the owner has no pipe he may offer cigarettes or food after a few brief high pitched solos to warm up voices the leader of the group sang the first line of his song his loud falsetto voice echoed across the camp the others with him joined in on the second line which was a repeat of the first the silence inside our tipi was overcome by the chorus of voices singing JA HE JA HE JA HE JA HE LE LE HE LE LE HE YOOOO the singers began their song quietly and with an easy tempo the sounds of the song are not words with meanings but syllables that create a feeling the drumbeat was slow and steady the voices sang softly but distinctly the five singers were sitting on chairs they carried with them about twenty of us wearing blankets over our clothes stood in a loose circle around the singers watching their faces and the movements of their drumsticks most of us gathered around the drum were young people some wore cowboy hats bell bottomed trousers and mod boots the tempo of the song began to quicken after it had been repeated several times we caught on to the tune and joined the singing tapping our feet and rocking in time to the rapid drumbeats the groups enthusiasm continued to grow at the end of each round the leader quickly repeated the opening line before anyone could attempt a concluding note and interrupt the spirit that was flowing with the music the leader finally struck four extra hard drumbeats signifying his intention to end the song after that round everyone was physically exhausted from such intense involvement when the last note died away a moment of absolute silence reigned in the camp suddenly someone from within the tipi called out in an intentional understatement okinn is that all the tense air disappeared and we all broke out in laughter then someone from inside passed out a pack of cigarettes which the singers shared with each other

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the songs are made up of sentences or verses they are invocations remembrances descriptions short legends which recall the relationship of the life of the indian with the disincarnated aroe and with the several lives that the same aroe go through according to the system of metempsychosis of these savages the most frequently recalled aroe is bakororo 1 page 464 360 cont it is for this reason that the common name of bakurur to make the bakurur was given by the civilized to the songs of the orarimogo and to the representations of their aroe the language used in the songs is not always the ordinary one because many words are replaced by others some of which are antiquated forms and already in disuse in the common talk and preserved by 361 tradition in the songs others are metaphorical words for religious allusions frequently quite hidden and unintelligible for this reason ordinary objects ornaments animals localities are indicated with names completely different from those of the common language this is a serious obstacle which is placed in the way of perfect knowledge and of sure and exact translation of the songs even more so since their religious mentality is completely different from ours

LYRICS:
 you see naga you were born as a human being you should have gratitude for your mother whenever you cried your mother held your body and let you suck milk from her bosom whenever you soiled your panties mother washed them and changed them for you then would she grind rice for you to eat three times each day she would not let you worry the beauteous one may you be grateful whenever you were ill father and mother tended you eagerly sought for doctor and medicine however much it cost father and mother never feared of loss the meritorious one of father and mother you see naga you were born as a human being you may take part in the religious order presently father and mother are getting old they have brought you up with hardship may you think of their virtuous ways which have upheld you since you are mother's son at the time mother was delivering you it was all easy and comfortable freed from pricks and pains however much to spend father and mother have never cared just so that father and mother can hold your monk robe you see naga you should not be born for nothing may you first repay her for the drops of milk let you not be worried about other things you were born as a human being whose highest excellence lies in the world of monkhood whereas to enter is not easy just let both father and mother tell you how hard they have acquired all things when you were still young and tiny father and mother had to strain however hard and tired father and mother never complained but deep in her heart mother thought one day she might be able to see you a monk on naga at the time mother was delivering you it was easy and comfortable and it turned out particularly to be you a son mother fondled you and doted on you the beauteous one she would not let mosquitoes or bed bugs around mother never went far she only stayed and cared for you mother gave you papers and pencils both mother and father never refused them just so that father and mother can see your monk robe to be or not to be she does not mind she only wishes to hold a monk ceremony for you that is all when mother's life comes to an end mother will then hold on to your monk robe and the consequence of sins which she has committed may be endurable on naga think you of the blessed virtues of father and mother they love you truly where can you find a love so true may you enter monkhood to return her goodness in holding you in her womb until you were grown let tomorrow afternoon be the time when your father and mother can see your yellow robe of monkhood

 o how heavenly happy they all come to celebrate your entering monkhood naga who has a great deal of confidence in the religion may you keep your mind firm and clear for it's only tomorrow my dear naga that your holy teacher will give you your monk robe you have just a short time left have you said the last words to your girl friend well if you have not said good bye does she come here today where does she take her seat pray let me know now which one is she my dear naga maybe it's the one sitting by you on your right or this one or that you'd better give her your words that you would like to take your leave to become a monk that in the second month at the latest you would be back and the girl friend who is left behind you should never fail him you should be firm and wait for him when the twelfth month comes you will then take a boat down to your home and neighborhood the day you're going to enter the monastery will you sneak in to say good bye to her or will you go without it you know she would complain that you did not care to say good bye to her i was like that once so i just have to tell you those who relish the worldly will always find sufferings in it there may be fun and joy at times but it makes you waver as if you were climbing a rubber tree in the storms my dear naga after you have taken the holy order you should acquire the right knowledge and be firm without doubts in aiming at the dhamma after you have taken holy order you should endeavor to study the religious teachings and see that they are clear in your mind after you have taken the order you should discuss and recite religious chants and teachings make recitations habitually and let the elderly monks hear them you should not just eat and then sneak in to sleep you are a new monk in the order you should pay attention to the teachings in wearing your monk robe there are many disciplinary rules concerning it in the first lent you should endeavor to study and become a third class lecturer in buddhism and may you pass a class each year and then continue to study the pali language when you are relaxing you should always bring your mind to some focus and make your bed and keep it clean for you to rest on when you worship worship with flowers and light your candles and burn your incense sticks then you begin your recitation with na mo then go on to iti piso bhagava recite the sam buddhae and then yae santa and chant imina every night when you lie down and have not fallen asleep or are feeling restless just repeat it in your mind when you are up and awake still should you recite your prayers don't be put to shame by other monks after you have taken holy order don't be a bother you eat and get up early in the morning in order to receive food offerings thus paying back what you owed those people in the past this is the duty you have to do when you go out receiving food offerings you must be solemn and strict in your disciplines look ahead only as far as a wa be not distracted by a girl nor stare at her until you walk right into a buffalo if so you would be put to shame by other monks who go with you when you go out receiving food offerings if there's a woman a devout maker of merit who wishes to offer foods to you who are observing the brahma rules or khao lam or sugar or sweet bananas and tiny bananas don't act as if you were going out of your old home and be over familiar by saying to yourself oh today the siga has given me such and such don't you bring yourself to any hasty action or conclusion

thailand to enter monkhood is not required for the whole lifetime a young man may take the order only during the lenten season the eighth through the eleventh lunar months monkhood is the most serious education one can have in a traditional society thus a man who has gone through it will be considered suk or ripe and is then eligible for marriage in the second section lines 28 ff the singer gives various advice to the naga first he should learn the buddhist prayers in pali since these form a necessary part of ritual worship the prayers are actually hymns of praise of the merit of the buddha the dhamma his teachings and the sangha the buddhist order second he is encouraged to devote his time to the study of the buddhist principles the singer of this song refers to the study of theoretical aspects rather than the practice of mediation in this case they may take the annual examinations given by the national committee of the holy order there are altogether nine classes of lecturer in the buddhist order in thailand monks study not only the history the discipline and the theory of buddhism they also have to master the pali language which is the official language in the transmission of buddhist doctrine third the singer gives advice pertaining to the regular conduct of a monk he should pay attention to all the disciplinary rules such as one concerning his holy garment when he walks he should not cast his eyes in various directions he should calmly cast his eyes forward not more than a wa or two metres he is not to let himself be distracted by girls or show a sign of familiarity with any in other words the singer is reminding the naga of the new responsibilities and livelihood the naga is about to take

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the rain making ritual the rain making ritual was started as a uniting effort for the good of the agricultural products in the community in times of drought the traditional device for calling rain is to carry a female cat in a procession around the village people usually pick a cat that is reared in the temple putting it in a cage they carry it from one house to another first they sing the chunmum devata gatha in invitation to the gods to witness the event and their wish for rain then they go on to other songs usually obscene in nature kanob nuttanond says he used to remember many but recalls only one A WIDOW HAS MANY CHILDREN AND MISERABLE IS SHE THERE IS NO RAIN THIS YEAR THE FATHER IN LAW AND THE SON IN LAW THEY PUT THEIR ARMS ON THE FOREHEAD THE WIDOW HAS MANY CHILDREN AND MISERABLE IS SHE THERE IS NO RAIN THIS YEAR LET THE RAIN FALL DOWN FALL DOWN as they stop at each house somebody in the house will have to welcome them and throw water on the cat when the procession is over people from different households will bring rice coconuts or other kinds of food to the temple they will cook rice with coconut milk and feast together at the temple whatever is left is not taken home but donated to it

LYRICS:
 there were three people the husband's name was suchata the wife's name was sunanda the son's name was kantachatana his age was sixteen one day the father sat brooding and felt sad for he wished to hold a kathin ceremony but he had no money and didn't know what to do he thought of it and could not see it through suddenly an idea came to his mind and he thought maybe it would be successful since he had been thinking about it for a long time so he called his wife and son unto him and said i've thought about this for a long time i wish to hold a kathin ceremony for once i wish to hold a kathin ceremony in order to pave the way after we are here no more we may enter the heavenly land of braham the wife however said 0 we may not live up to our expectation it seems as if we were sailing against wind and all will be to no avail is it so sunanda it's me who will go and find a job and the three of us will go together maybe somebody will hire us we will work hard day or night we will not idle whenever we have enough to buy all the necessities for the ceremony we will come home the wife agreed and followed her husband's desire they all went to a wealthy man's house they saw a number of people working and were glad so they walked right in when they saw the wealthy man they paid obeisance to him the wealthy man asked why have all three of you come suchata replied we have come to earn ourselves a living we are very poor we come here hoping sir that you will kindly hire us may you be merciful to us you can have us work in your plantation or in the field it's all up to you kind sir we would like to receive a certain wage but you may sir give us some food and lodging whatever you wish us do whether it's evening or night we will not be slow we hope to save enough money to buy the necessity for the kathin ceremony the wealthy man having heard felt merciful and wished to help for they were virtuous and hoped to make merit since they did not have money they were willing to work for it so the wealthy man said all right i will hire you but you should never sleep late my rice fields and plantations are many you should look after them well so the three attended to their job evening or night they would not be idle their food was not enough because the wealthy one was stingy the three worked long and hard even when they had nothing to eat they would not give up their work they worked for many a month and many a day and got enough money for their purpose so they said good bye to the wealthy man and went back to their home they had enough to buy the monk robe and other necessities then they carried them on a procession when they arrived at the temple they raised their hands in obeisance and prayed together the three of them they prayed that after they had died and left this world they hoped to be born in the heaven and if they had ended their days in the heaven and had to be reborn in the womb of a human being they hoped to take a form that was beauteous and fine in the story sung by biang borisut above the family was depicted as being poor yet the father mother and son wished to make the kathin offering this meritorious act was of course bigger than they were so they had to build up their egotistical entity by working and accumulating wealth once they reached the point they desired they gave it all away in the kathin ceremony yet their mind was gaining at the same time one more step on the ladder of boundlessness it is like building a bridge to the other side of the river once one has reached the other side one may leave the bridge forever unless one wishes to retrace the old steps 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the boundless merits of the kathin offerings are always elaborated by the singer during the celebration of the kathin robe the story used to illustrate the point is believed to have been recounted by the buddha himself the event is then supposed to have taken place in the historic time prior to this one according to the story there was a small family consisting of THE FATHER THE MOTHER AND THE SON THEY WERE VERY POOR HOWEVER THEY WISHED TO MAKE THE KATHIN OFFERING so they got themselves hired as workers in the house of a millionaire the singer biang borisut was careful in pointing out that they were poorly fed nevertheless they did not mind they worked hard and saved money enough to buy the kathin robe they made the offering and made a wish that upon death they would be born in the heaven and from this merit the three did attain their desires the singer therefore encouraged people to make special merits in the kathin ceremony the merit of the kathin offering 1 there were three people 2 THE HUSBAND'S NAME WAS SUCHATA 3 THE WIFE'S NAME WAS SUNANDA 4 THE SON'S NAME WAS KANTACHATANA HIS AGE WAS SIXTEEN 5 ONE DAY THE FATHER SAT BROODING AND FELT SAD 6 FOR HE WISHED TO HOLD A KATHIN CEREMONY 7 BUT HE HAD NO MONEY AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 8 HE THOUGHT OF IT AND COULD NOT SEE IT THROUGH 9 SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME TO HIS MIND 10 AND HE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL 11 SINCE HE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME 12 SO HE CALLED HIS WIFE AND SON UNTO HIM AND SAID 13 I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME 14 I WISH TO HOLD A KATHIN CEREMONY FOR ONCE 15 I WISH TO HOLD A KATHIN CEREMONY IN ORDER TO PAVE THE WAY 16 AFTER WE ARE HERE NO MORE 17 WE MAY ENTER THE HEAVENLY LAND OF BRAHAM 18 THE WIFE HOWEVER SAID 0 19 WE MAY NOT LIVE UP TO OUR EXPECTATION 20 IT SEEMS AS IF WE WERE SAILING AGAINST WIND 21 AND ALL WILL BE TO NO AVAIL 22 IS IT SO SUNANDA 23 IT'S ME WHO WILL GO AND FIND A JOB 24 AND THE THREE OF US WILL GO TOGETHER 25 MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL HIRE US 26 WE WILL WORK HARD 27 DAY OR NIGHT WE WILL NOT IDLE 28 WHENEVER WE HAVE ENOUGH TO BUY ALL THE NECESSITIES FOR THE CEREMONY 29 WE WILL COME HOME 30 THE WIFE AGREED 31 AND FOLLOWED HER HUSBAND'S DESIRE 32 THEY ALL WENT TO A WEALTHY MAN'S HOUSE 33 THEY SAW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORKING 34 AND WERE GLAD 35 SO THEY WALKED RIGHT IN 36 WHEN THEY SAW THE WEALTHY MAN 37 THEY PAID OBEISANCE TO HIM 38 THE WEALTHY MAN ASKED 39 WHY HAVE ALL THREE OF YOU COME 40 SUCHATA REPLIED WE HAVE COME TO EARN OURSELVES A LIVING 41 WE ARE VERY POOR WE COME HERE HOPING SIR THAT 42 YOU WILL KINDLY HIRE US 43 MAY YOU BE MERCIFUL TO US 44 YOU CAN HAVE US WORK IN YOUR PLANTATION 45 OR IN THE FIELD IT'S ALL UP TO YOU KIND SIR 46 WE WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE A CERTAIN WAGE 47 BUT YOU MAY SIR GIVE US SOME FOOD AND LODGING 48 WHATEVER YOU WISH US DO WHETHER IT'S EVENING OR NIGHT 49 WE WILL NOT BE SLOW 50 WE HOPE TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY THE NECESSITY 51 FOR THE KATHIN CEREMONY 52 THE WEALTHY MAN HAVING HEARD FELT MERCIFUL AND WISHED TO HELP 53 FOR THEY WERE VIRTUOUS AND HOPED TO MAKE MERIT 54 SINCE THEY DID NOT HAVE MONEY THEY WERE WILLING 55 TO WORK FOR IT SO THE WEALTHY MAN SAID 56 ALL RIGHT I WILL HIRE YOU 57 BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER SLEEP LATE 58 MY RICE FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS ARE MANY 59 YOU SHOULD LOOK AFTER THEM WELL 60 SO THE THREE ATTENDED TO THEIR JOB 61 EVENING OR NIGHT THEY WOULD NOT BE IDLE 62 THEIR FOOD WAS NOT ENOUGH 63 BECAUSE THE WEALTHY ONE WAS STINGY 64 THE THREE WORKED LONG AND HARD 65 EVEN WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT 66 THEY WOULD NOT GIVE UP THEIR WORK 67 THEY WORKED FOR MANY A MONTH AND MANY A DAY 68 AND GOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR THEIR PURPOSE 69 SO THEY SAID GOOD BYE TO THE WEALTHY MAN 70 AND WENT BACK TO THEIR HOME 71 THEY HAD ENOUGH TO BUY THE MONK ROBE AND OTHER NECESSITIES 72 THEN THEY CARRIED THEM ON A PROCESSION 73 WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE TEMPLE THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS 74 IN OBEISANCE AND PRAYED TOGETHER THE THREE OF THEM 75 THEY PRAYED THAT AFTER THEY HAD DIED AND LEFT THIS WORLD 76 THEY HOPED TO BE BORN IN THE HEAVEN 77 AND IF THEY HAD ENDED THEIR DAYS IN THE HEAVEN 78 AND HAD TO BE REBORN IN THE WOMB OF A HUMAN BEING 79 THEY HOPED TO TAKE A FORM THAT WAS BEAUTEOUS AND FINE THEY MADE THEIR WISH THUS after they had died the three of them were born in the dusit heaven they stayed there for 40 000 years and had a great number of serving angels all these were due to the merit of the kathin offering

LYRICS:
 indra heard the address of mora the evil maiden i will curse her to be a gibbon hanging around looking for husband then he recited incantations now i pass the curse the gibbon swung herself calling her husband aloud in the wild wood she swung herself calling her husband aloud she knew not her own glory and caused him harm that's why she had to suffer and was cursed by indra she was not interested in merits she was only wrapped up in desires having no faithfulness whatsoever so she swung and swayed having no fear for she had no conscience for what she's doing the gibbon was swinging herself on the branches calling her husband all the time back to chanda korob he arrived at the meditation cave where mujalind the naga's daughter was staying she was chanda korob's true love when chanda korob got to the mouth of the cave he saw the mechanical yakshas two of them there were inscribed also these words if you have power to kill the two mechanical yakshas at the mouth of the cave you may enter the cave your true love is in the cave only a meritorious and knowledgeable person could go in after he had examined chanda korob thought this must be the place that the ajarn had told i'd better kill the mechanical yakshas at the mouth of the cave and then i will enter this meditation cave as the inscription suggests they were delighted inside chanda korob asked the mechanical yakshas and the latter said we are the naga king's soldiers he had us guard this cave that is in this meditation cave his daughter's staying she makes a wish that if her true love comes he will be able to kill us and enter the cave chanda korob said is that true yes so chanda korob said if i kill both of you i'll enter the cave if i cannot kill you i'll not enter the cave all right if you won't let me enter you and i will find out who's better we'll see chanda korob was trying to speak nicely but the yakshas did not care for it both sides were angry and began to fight right in front of the meditation cave chanda korob was dead once and was resuscitated by his ajarn this time chanda korob had no fear he said he would get into the meditation cave even though it's a matter of life and death he thought of the ascetic and paid obeisance if she were my true love let me not suffer let there be no ill no danger let me have power to kill the two yakshas chanda korob dressed himself and said you yakshas beware if you won't let me in you'll see our strength then he dashed up to them when chanda saw the yakshas dead he walked right in chanda paid obeisance to the ascetic kindly come to show me the way to open the meditation cave my power is still little i do not dare may the ajarn help me think of the path that leads through i don't care for my life even if it will be extinguished in the meditation cave i will try to get in illuminated was the temple ground silent and lighted by a lamp fire a black bird was singing away sweetly while an oriole flew up and perched on the nom meo you happy sri suk thet flowered into a soke you should not suffer from the illness of forgetting you have forgotten our old promises that were so heart felt you have forgotten the past words and the promises we made under the cloudy sky when there were thunderstorms your brother used to sit by you our bodies pressed close together and we sat there listening to the murmuring sky you did make a vow in front of a buddha image that you will never leave me but it has not been long after you're away when you forget the vow you happy sri suk that flowered into a soke you should not suffer from the illness of forgetting you the tiny ring of my little finger you were not stuck to ask how can you fly to here you the tiny padded ring that has put on so many couples that no man can go through you the tiny padded ring you cannot join me in my dream now chanda korob lived with mujalind they became husband and wife in the cave they were waiting for the father the naga king to come up but he didn't but mujalind was expecting to have a baby so chanda korob persuaded her better not remain in the meditation cave since your father and mother have not come to greet you we should say goodbye to the meditation cave they left the meditation cave and chanda korob led her to his city before they left she inscribed at the mouth of the cave to tell the father and mother now i have got a husband named chanda korob so i'll say goodbye to father and mother in order to go visit my husband's parents at ayudhya when i'm happy and comfortable i'll come back to visit you in the cave then chanda korob recited an incantation he put a piece of cloth on the ground and made it into a junk his ajarn had given it to him it was made of grass and then he turned it into a magic junk that could travel in the air then they stopped to rest in a forest they were tired so they stopped to rest in the forest they were going to sleep for a while now a yaksha woman was going about looking for food along the edge of the forest she went out and found chanda korob lying sleeping by the side of mujalind so she made them unconscious and carried mujalind away then she beat mujalind up and asked her who chanda korob was mujalind said he was her brother but the yaksha said not your brother just tell me frankly he's your husband you stole my husband i'll keep you here and curse you she cursed her to become dumb and act like a mad woman then the yaksha disguised herself and lay down by chanda korob when chanda korob woke up he saw his wife was there all right so he took her home through the air back to the country mujalind was cursed to become mad so she ran about in the forest not knowing what to do she had to suffer when they got to the city chanda korob went to pay obeisance to his parents and told them about his study the yaksha woman was with him and both of them were nicely welcomed by the parents they asked their son how was it son that you've come back so soon did you have any trouble so chanda korob told them my ajarn gave me such and such and it was a waste then i came to the meditation cave and got mujalind as my wife so i brought her here with me you think of it the inscription said that she was my true love so i killed two mechanical yakshas at the mouth of the cave here she is i've brought her to you the parents looked at her oh usually human beings have a reflection in their eyes this woman has not anyway they told them to have a good rest since they had been traveling and were quite exhausted when the morning came they would ask how they were to have gotten home so soon the next day that dumb girl arrived she was pretty close to the city now chanda korob said father would you please summon an astrologer and have him tell whether my wife can govern the land with me the astrologer examined and said this woman cannot govern the land but the girl whom you took out of the cave can did you stop anywhere on your way back the astrologer asked did you stop to rest or go to sleep in the forest he said we went to sleep when you woke up did you find anything wrong or did you feel that anything went wrong did you notice chanda korob said i have observed everything but i've found nothing wrong well since the astrologer said so father is also suspicious can the astrologer tell frankly as to whether or not this girl whom he has brought is mujalind the astrologer said not that one she was exchanged the king asked how did it happen do you know the astrologer examined and said soon the girl who was exchanged would be in town she'll be in town in a couple of days so you can send some men out to see whether there is any stranger especially a dumb and mad girl not long after that the mad girl came she was pointing at this and that not knowing what she's doing she could not tell anything about herself the astrologer said the girl who can govern the land has come now she can't do it because there's still a treacherous person the wife of chanda korob she was not an ordinary human being she was a devil in disguise so the astrologer suggested that they should find someone who could catch the yaksha they should see her when she came out to dance if it had been mujalind she would not have a bold manner she would keep herself quiet and graceful now they were planning on capturing the yaksha and they also kept the dumb girl to see what she would turn out to be now the courtiers were going to catch the yaksha so they're going to sing and arrange a dancing each one joined in the dancing without delay they extended their arms and moved according to the rhythm then they danced in pairs and displayed their foot movement they danced in pairs the yaksha got excited she forgot she was a yaksha with ugly and ferocious gestures she forgot she was a yaksha not knowing her neck would soon be broken now they saw who she was so the king announced we've caught the yaksha and of course we cannot keep her in the city now let us ask her how she had come and disguised herself so if she felt herself guilty let her change her way of life or she'll die he told the soldiers to surround the city not to let the yaksha escape through any door if she escaped through any door the guard of that door would be executed by having his head chopped off well the yaksha was cornered so she thought of escaping from the city otherwise she would be in trouble the yaksha transformed herself when it was night when it was night she hastened out she was afraid of dangers today there's a way so i'll escape who'll know it she felt uneasy when chanda korob found that the yaksha had escaped chanda korob said to his parents the yaksha has escaped from our city it transformed itself and stole in i don't know where mujaland is at the moment let our astrologer predict if mujaland has not come to our city see whether it's the same one as this mad dumb girl let us examine carefully i'll go and kill this yaksha then i'll be back the astrologer said this mad dumb girl is of course chanda korob's true love so you may follow the yaksha and bring back her blood we will pour the blood on her chanda korob paid obeisance to his father and left his city with a furious mind the yaksha in disguise came to our city i know not of its deceit oh mujaland my beloved wife how would she suffer and cry how is she doing now i do not know for certain i'll follow the yaksha into the forest i will kill her he paid obeisance to his father and hastened out chanda korob searched for her but could not find her so he went back to his ajarn's hut he recounted to him the incident so the ajarn calculated to see whether he would be able to catch the yaksha chanda korob paid obeisance and asked his ajarn to see who the mad dumb girl in his city was the ascetic listened to his nephew who said there's a beautiful maiden in time of misfortune she was separated from me in the forest will i ever see her again may i ask you who the girl is who is both dumb and mad the ascetic listened to his nephew and calculated according to his system he told chanda korob as he thought you go back to your city there is nothing to worry about i will give you an important thing to bring back her mind then you'll realize that she's your sister he accepted his words and left the hut when he arrived at the city he felt unhappy he paid obeisance and told his father that he'd gone to the ascetic but could not find the yaksha woman the ascetic suggested that i return he had given something to bring her back it's a magic object given by the ascetic in order to revive mujalind and rid us all of unhappiness she's dumb and can speak no sense then he told the soldiers go bring the dumb girl in here father ordered you to bring the dumb girl i want to know for certain whether she is the lady whether she is mujalind or just a dumb girl the ascetic told me to hurry back to see now you go and pull her here don't be merciful to a mad dumb girl the soldiers were not slow they ran down to the front and pulled the mad dumb girl in she would not understand and would not go so the soldiers pulled her in to meet the king paying obeisance the soldier said here i bring her as you wish chanda korob embraced her and felt sad oh my wife we've departed in the forest how is it that you have to be mad and dumb not knowing any right and wrong if our brother will revive you so that you may rule this palace the girl did not know that he was her husband she was astonished because she was mad whose house it was she did not know so he told her to bring her consciousness together and then he placed her in front the astrologer or an elderly man paid obeisance and made holy water they made a small spirit shrine as high as her eyes then they presented the high deities with all the liquor ducks chickens and pork they prayed that the deities would come and bless the girl oh mujalind now was she back to herself then she became conscious of herself she glanced and saw her husband so straight she went to him the father and paid obeisance chanda korob embraced her oh my love how you've followed for the sake of love how you've followed for the sake of love may you be happy and gay may you not have any ill father renders you his love his care i'll give you both the throne i thought you would not be able to return so now i let both of you rule the city amidst the cousins and relatives all

feeble they consoled her and powdered her face the nurses were on both sides hastened they hastened to travel oh no they were not in a hurry i'm afraid they were in the rooms nearby the nurses were on both sides how excited and uneasy they walked and when they came to a curtain they lowered themselves and walked on their knees when they got to the curtain they were close to khun phaen's seat the two women went right on in lao thong scooted backward and fell seated on the floor holding and pulling their hands she was nervous when the curtain was parted illuminated was the scene light suddenly flooded on her smooth radiant complexion oh my lao thong's face was really radiant lao thong sat with a downcast look they usually say she sat hiding her face behind the curtain and felt nervous and uneasy lao thong lowered herself down and felt uneasy while her nurses made way for her appearance but she fell behind her nurses' back at this time lao thong was still feeling unhappy this is to say lao thong still had uneasiness she was crying because she still missed her parents at home well they say if we have music we'll play the melody of ode now lao thong was sitting there using her nurses as her curtain she still wouldn't allow khun phaen to see her face she didn't want to meet his eyes because she's still sad there is an ode music will play the ode well it should not be too long now khun phaen or plai keo saw a bit of lao thong's face while she was hiding behind her servants so he began to chant a sepha verse at that time plai keo saw the girl hiding behind the backs the backs of her nurses so he knew that she was nervous how beautiful she was behind those nurses her complexion her face were radiant his heart was filled with love and pleased with desire so he smiled and began to speak to her my precious wouldn't you sit up don't stay behind the shade please sit in the light let's have a little delightful chat and may i ask you of your former vexation the day the army came to ban jom thong was sister frightened other homes had fled and gone but how did you dare stay alone or did someone tell you that your brother's here so you were kind not to fight or were there some good men so you did not leave your home at that time lao thong heard her two nurses she was feeling too uneasy to speak because she had never spoken the central language she was afraid her two sisters would leave her if they're gone who else could she find she was too shy to answer a man's words and she shuddered with timidity she was forced to speak yet she felt reluctant and had to turn her face aside her nurses pinched her to make her speak so with fear she uttered these words in a trembling voice i will consent to be your servant even if i have to go the southern country i have decided to go even if i am still attached to home i don't know what else to say kasem until lao thong could get rid of her timidity so he began to console her so that she would not be shy and that she would have enough courage to speak to him there's a song he handed the betel nuts to lao thong when lao thong had accepted it she's afraid that if she did not eat khun phaen would not allow her to go back so after she had eaten she felt satisfied and somewhat excitable because of khun phaen's incantation she looked at plai keo's face since she had eaten the betel nuts she felt longing and turned to glance she began to look at khun phaen plai keo saw her manner and knew that she was charmed so he turned to the nurses you may go now and be back some other day he told the two nurses to go back he said you may go leave lao thong with me here in my room she was charmed by khun phaen's incantation oh sister's yawning sister come so he put out the light preparing to sleep the two nurses walked out and closed the door without delay they had left lao thong now they told me to sing to the melody of lao soom plai keo got out of bed to see the door was closed his hands felt lao thong she was silent and made no cry she was already charmed from now on she had to be khun phaen's wife under the magic spell under the magic spell in those days people had no other knowledge except for magic art and this is an old story plai keo got out of bed to see that the door was closed oh the young maiden his hands felt lao thong she was silent and made no cry oh the young maiden he lowered her and placed her on the bed and murmured oh yourbrother welcomes your soul he smiled and embraced her oh the bewildering scent of powder and perfume

 players on these instruments have a very limited r pertoire but they have some curious rhymes or jingles which seem to suit the tunes they play and by which they are remembered in much the same way that a british soldier suits words to the bugle calls one of these jingles runs ang jik to jik mani chami it has little or no meaning being merely the words MY WIFE MY SISTER IN LAW MY DEAR but when said in a sing song the sound of the words is not unlike the tune they are meant to represent

 wife of the household head and a most important spirit in kano magajiyar jangare is hardly mentioned elsewhere part of the reason for this lies in the way in which kano mediums fall into trance unlike ningi and maiduguri where spirits are called individually with their own songs their mediums entering possession trance one at a time kano ceremonies are usually organized so that all the mediums present fall into trance to the accompaniment of the same music the event is described as unusual if a medium needs a special spirits song played to induce trance the single piece which provides the final inducement for trance is one song for magajiyar jangare an introductory period precedes this sequence during which relatively slow invocational music to prepare the trancers is played mai iyali they say is male not female and is also known as kunnau or ali sarkin rafis brother king comments on this point stating that many of his informants thought mai iyali and ali were identical there being strong supporting evidence for this in the song text he illnesses ascribed to her are headache pneumonia and impotence in men the data however include no examples of anyone ever having been afflicted by her and this is perhaps due to the attitude in kano that she is not easily angered as it is sung algaje a bar fada magajiya ga magajiya ba ma algaje magajiya FIGHTING HAS CEASED MAGAJIYA HERE IS MAGAJIYA WE SHALL PROBABLY NOT SHA WUYA BA HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY

 example 19 below includes two songs for kure and the transition between them the first song which was short on the occasion of this particular recording is given in its entirety the chorus singing only two responses before the lute player began the transition the transition between the songs consisted of a short lute statement with an underlying text the text was a praise epithet for the hyena and the chorus translated its second half as it was played the full kirari praise epithet was given as follows kowa yai dare ko far fada zai tad da kure ANYONE WHO IS AT THE PALACE GATE AT NIGHT WILL OVERTAKE THE HYEN the second song is given in excerpted form but it can be seen that it sounds more open than the first using fewer sixteenth notes in both the sung and lute melodies

 as in dancing so in music kachina songs seem to be differentiated from other kinds of songs although there is not enough material dealing with hopi music by itself a comparison of western pueblo music which includes the hopi with that of the eastern pueblos showed that the former were more specialized and more elaborate and that the rhythm attained the most complex forms known to date in american indian music most kachinas sing their own songs the only accompaniment being their bells and rattles however some have a drummer and page 17 some as qa' kachina plate xxv have a chorus to sing for them this is usually necessary in the lively and more vigorous dances when one sees a kachina dance for the first time he is not always aware of the variety of songs for they all seem the same this is partly due to the muffling effect of the mask and partly to the fact that each kachina type has its own style of singing but as soon as the songs of three different kachinas are sung without masks it is easy to distinguish them ten to fourteen new songs are composed for each dance the number of songs determining how many times they will come to dance during the day anyone may compose a song men who are not taking part often make songs and sing them for the men who are practicing in a sense every song is a prayer and the words express either the message of the hopi to the clouds and the chiefs of the directions or the message of the clouds and kachinas to the hopi the same ideas the same phrases are used over and over in all kachina songs in fact it is really another medium in which the symbols for rain corn fertility and growth are expressed the sections of the song are broken by the use of vocables LISTEN MY MOTHERS YOU HAVE PRAYED THAT IT WOULD RAIN ON YOUR PLANTS LI I HI LA LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN MY FATHERS YOU HAVE PRAYED THAT IT WOULD RAIN ON YOUR PLANTS LI I HI LA WHEN YOU LOOK AFTER THE RAIN YOU SHALL SEE WHAT YOU PRAYED FOR LI I HI LA WHEN RAIN FALLS AMONG YOUR PLANTS YOU SHALL SEE POOLS OF WATER MY FATHERS THIS IS WHAT YOU PRAYED FOR OHO OHOWA IHI IHIYI HIHO OHO HAYANANI OHO HAYANANI HAYANANI HAYANI AHA AHA IHI IHI AI AIHAI IHI IHI LISTEN LISTEN MY FATHERS YOU PRAYED FOR US YONDER TO THE WEST AT THE HOUSE OF ALOSAKA CHIEF WE HEARD HAPPILY WE PREPARED MANY KINDS OF CORN MANY KINDS OF CLOUDS WE PREPARED THEN WE STARTED TO COME ALONG THE ROADS MADE BY THESE OLD MEN THE CHIEFS AHA AHA IHI IHI SO COMING FROM EACH DIRECTION WE SHALL SPRINKLE RAIN THIS IS WHAT YOU PRAYED FOR MY FATHERS YOHO WIYA HIYA AYA YOU START SMOKING YOUR PIPE AND HAND IT TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THE CLOUDS WILL APPROACH WITH RAIN AHA IHI AHA IHI

LYRICS:
 ye fowls were ever the race ever the seed for sacrifice from our grandfathers and grandmothers from ancient times from chiefs of old down to your fathers and mothers because we give you rice we breed you we give you food give you nourishment we hang for you nests we make for you roosts we make you coops we make you baskets hence ye fowls are used for substituting for buying substitutes for the face substitutes for the life 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the manang 's choice of a fowl for sacrifice is not insignificant the chant goes on to describe many other birds but the manang asserts they are all ineffectual as sacrifice they are not worth a fowl as big as the fingers that is the thing for waving and for offering he then explains the fowl's particular appropriateness YE FOWLS WERE EVER THE RACE EVER THE SEED FOR SACRIFICE FROM OUR GRANDFATHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS FROM ANCIENT TIMES FROM CHIEFS OF OLD DOWN TO YOUR FATHERS AND MOTHERS BECAUSE WE GIVE YOU RICE WE BREED YOU WE GIVE YOU FOOD GIVE YOU NOURISHMENT WE HANG FOR YOU NESTS WE MAKE FOR YOU ROOSTS WE MAKE YOU COOPS WE MAKE YOU BASKETS HENCE YE FOWLS ARE USED FOR SUBSTITUTING FOR BUYING SUBSTITUTES FOR THE FACE SUBSTITUTES FOR THE LIFE

LYRICS:
 the speckled fowl for sacrificial waving and cleansing for doctoring for resisting for sweeping for atoning for exchanging for buying a substitute for the feet substitute for the hands a substitute for the face substitute for the life ye fowls enable us to escape the curse muttered unheard to neutralize the spittle of the enemy to correct the speech of the angry despiser to make nought the visions of half waking moments to scare away evil dreams for ever to make harmless one's ghost passing the farm to neutralize the ill omen bird flying across the path to cut off the katupong 's flight coming from the left to cover its screeching bird of dread effect to make harmless the pangkas a hot tempered bird to counteract the omen of the low voiced deer hence ye fowls are for waving and for offering 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the final segment of a pelian involves the sacrifice of a fowl prior to the sacrifice the fowl is waved over the patient as the manang sings a special invocation THE SPECKLED FOWL FOR SACRIFICIAL WAVING AND CLEANSING FOR DOCTORING FOR RESISTING FOR SWEEPING FOR ATONING FOR EXCHANGING FOR BUYING A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE FEET SUBSTITUTE FOR THE HANDS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE FACE SUBSTITUTE FOR THE LIFE YE FOWLS ENABLE US TO ESCAPE THE CURSE MUTTERED UNHEARD TO NEUTRALIZE THE SPITTLE OF THE ENEMY TO CORRECT THE SPEECH OF THE ANGRY DESPISER TO MAKE NOUGHT THE VISIONS OF HALF WAKING MOMENTS TO SCARE AWAY EVIL DREAMS FOR EVER TO MAKE HARMLESS ONE'S GHOST PASSING THE FARM TO NEUTRALIZE THE ILL OMEN BIRD FLYING ACROSS THE PATH TO CUT OFF THE KATUPONG 'S FLIGHT COMING FROM THE LEFT TO COVER ITS SCREECHING BIRD OF DREAD EFFECT TO MAKE HARMLESS THE PANGKAS A HOT TEMPERED BIRD TO COUNTERACT THE OMEN OF THE LOW VOICED DEER HENCE YE FOWLS ARE FOR WAVING AND FOR OFFERING these two verses clearly depict the manang 's sacrificial fowl as an offering to the antu in place of the life of the patient the fowl also bears the brunt of ill omens of all kinds absorbing and neutralizing them the poetic structure a pairing of terms within each line in the first verse and a pairing of descriptive phrases into couplets in the second verse arrays subtle variations on the theme expressed this synthetic form of semantic parallelism does not merely reiterate the message in a redundant fashion rather it both extends and consolidates the overall image as near synonymous terms and phrases pile up different nuances of meaning

 the boys when they go to the sleeping places of the girls often play on the bi ong called also wigwi gan this is a kind of jews harp made of a single flat strip of bamboo about three or four inches long a quarter inch broad and an eighth of an inch thick the tongue about two inches long has its free end about two thirds way toward the left end of the instrument and is set in vibration by stroking repeatedly with a finger of the right hand the projecting right end of the instrument the bi ong is held with the left hand between the lips close to but not touching the teeth when playing the bi ong the boys move their lips just as they do when speaking on several occasions we have heard them playing it the music produced seems to be nothing but some three or four different notes following each other irregularly in such a way that the duration of the sounds is sometimes long and sometimes short with higher or lower tones mixed up or following each other in all sorts of ways so at least it sounds but the young mayawyaw people emphatically assert that they sing real songs by means of this instrument songs which the girls inside the aga mang understand very well and to which they answer in the same way if they happen to page 172 have a bi ong these songs are clearly of a lascivious type and for this reason the boys are reluctant to give us the words of them

LYRICS:
 one sang against the chief gaunaule and sang of his people that he would finally destroy them first he destroyed a force of ninety and for the second to the fourth time he destroyed ninety of his people each time as chief and ruler he possessed no greatness that is why anyone who is in authority may not punish his people 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 from the fact that formerly the old temple of noavaka was thought to be in the region of this mountain it is clear why he is treated in the song 120 as chief of the people of noavaka ONE SANG AGAINST THE CHIEF GAUNAULE AND SANG OF HIS PEOPLE THAT HE WOULD FINALLY DESTROY THEM FIRST HE DESTROYED A FORCE OF NINETY AND FOR THE SECOND TO THE FOURTH TIME HE DESTROYED NINETY OF HIS PEOPLE EACH TIME AS CHIEF AND RULER HE POSSESSED NO GREATNESS THAT IS WHY ANYONE WHO IS IN AUTHORITY MAY NOT PUNISH HIS PEOPLE therefore this is a matter of a magical protective measure when a new priest who as is known is chief at the same time takes up his position so that he may not force his people to emigrate and drive them to destruction through overly harsh punishments particularly hunger punishments the fact that the song is sung in connection with the installation of a new government commissioner agrees with this

 this was said to be a very humorous song and the statement that the salt water barrel came to see the fresh water barrel was greeted with much laughter on the part of the tule who hear the song recorded tule songs are not characterized by units of rhythm but this song contains two phrases which were repeated several times the repetitions probably occurring with the statement that if something should loose its hold the water would flow out of the barrel only a few phrases of the transcription are presented and the words are condensed AT THE TOP OF THE RIVER THERE IS A BIG BARREL FOUR FATHOMS AROUND IT IS FULL OF WATER AND THERE ARE EIGHT PLUGS IN ITS SIDE A WATERBIRD SITS ON THE BARREL IT IS A PRETTY BIRD WITH FEATHERS LIKE PINK AND RED ROSES AND BRIGHT BLUE FLOWERS THE WATERBIRD HOLDS ONE OF THE EIGHT PLUGS IF IT SHOULD LET GO THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER EVERYTHING A LITTLE ROUND SHELL IS HOLDING ONE OF THE PLUGS IF IT SHOULD LET GO THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER EVERYTHING ONE OF THE PLUGS IS HELD BY A LITTLE FLAT FISH THAT LIVES IN THE SUN UNDER THE ROCKS OF THE RIVER IF IT SHOULD LET GO ITS HOLD THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER EVERYTHING PAGE 33 34C A LONG SLIPPERY EEL HOLDS ONE OF THE PLUGS IF IT SHOULD LET GO ITS HOLD THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER EVERYTHING A BROWN CRAB HOLDS ONE OF THE PLUGS IF IT SHOULD LET GO THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER EVERYTHING A RIVER CRAB HOLDS ONE OF THE PLUGS IF IT SHOULD LET GO THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER EVERYTHING A LITTLE RIVER FISH HOLDS ONE OF THE PLUGS IF IT SHOULD LET GO THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER EVERYTHING A VERY SMALL CRAWFISH HOLDS ONE OF THE PLUGS

 in contrast with the stampeding invisible animals in the underworld the singers visible audience has by now quieted down considerably most of the young children have fallen asleep some in their parents arms some stretched out on benches and some on blankets and sheets spread on the floor at the womens feet adults who were chatting are now silent although the womens headcloths which can be pulled around to veil their faces and the hats tipped low over the mens eyes make it difficult to tell whether eyes are open or shut quite a few individuals are nodding and swaying slightly the leaders sitting around the central arena make efforts to sit upright and either stay awake or give the impression of wakefulness but many others farther from the singers do not work so hard at keeping up appearances a couple of village policemen are still patrolling and they occasionally nudge someone who starts to snore but generally they leave the audience in peace except for their periodic calls even among the people not fully awake however many or most just catnap or let their eyes fall shut for a few minutes at a time without really dozing off and even in that state they take in a great deal of the chant two secretaries sitting at their table immediately to one side of the central arena are busily writing in a school notebook taking attendance for the meeting occasionally one bobs up to peer at an individual sitting in a dark corner and then mutters his or her name to the other meanwhile the singer continues surveying the features of the underworld with winds blowing trees waving banners flapping and making mysterious noises golden lamps flashing rain falling finally he describes god giving a mission to olokuknipippilele BOY OLOKUKNIPIPPILELE I SEND YOU TO OPAKKAKUN PLACE BOY OLOKUKNIPIPPILELE WEAR THE GOLDEN SUIT BOY OLOKUKNIPIPPILELE PUT ON THE GOLDEN SHIRT BOY OLOKUKNIPIPPILELE PUT ON THE GOLDEN SHOES BOY OLOKUKNIPIPPILELE PLACE THE GOLDEN HEADDRESS ON YOUR HEAD I SEND YOU TO OPAKKAKUN PLACE HE SAID the chant alternates between great fathers admonishment of olokuknipippilele preparations for his journey and descriptions of underworld topography which are full of roaring ocean waves bridges that move back and forth and whirlpools holding dangerous spirit animals see chapin 1983 99 100 189 olokuknipippilele then sets out for opakkakun place

LYRICS:
 my warnings are to the old man who imprisons the freedom of youths whos forgotten a thing called love affection desire and burning flames whos forgotten how strong is the fire of lovers how strong the fire of lovers who long for one another whats exquisite is that theyre afraid they say any minute my prying guard will turn up oh my fathers about to catch us 

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 i had unexpected confirmation of the new use of love on my visit in january 1987 when i was listening with friends to one of the latest cassettes of popular bedouin songs of a different genre there was a page 40 long and somewhat humorous song about the tribulations of a young man whose father and uncle had arranged three terrible marriages for him with women hed never met the first woman turned out to be bald the second dumb and the third insane and violent to boot in the final verse of his song the poet speaking on behalf of all young men who have suffered the tyranny of such fathers and uncles sings MY WARNINGS ARE TO THE OLD MAN WHO IMPRISONS THE FREEDOM OF YOUTHS WHOS FORGOTTEN A THING CALLED LOVE AFFECTION DESIRE AND BURNING FLAMES WHOS FORGOTTEN HOW STRONG IS THE FIRE OF LOVERS HOW STRONG THE FIRE OF LOVERS WHO LONG FOR ONE ANOTHER WHATS EXQUISITE IS THAT THEYRE AFRAID THEY SAY ANY MINUTE MY PRYING GUARD WILL TURN UP OH MY FATHERS ABOUT TO CATCH US the relationship between love and freedom in this song is complex because although he does not want the elders to force loveless marriages on their children the poet recognizes that what makes love exquisite is that it is stolen it is against the authority of elder agnates in other words he wants the freedom to defy the elders a bit a freedom he reminds them they used to want but he does not reject the system as a whole or want to have love easy or open

 but one special tape was the most frequently requested i had recorded it one afternoon when i happened to catch the spontaneous conversation and songs of two women sewing a tent together they were comfortable with me and with each other and save for the children we were alone in the household as they shredded and sewed fabric for a patchwork to decorate the tent walls they began to sing responding to each others songs in turn aziza initiated the singing with the following verse which can be interpreted to mean that the poet had tried patience but since it got her nowhere she finally gave up whenever i played this tape for women in the community they sat quietly and listened intently they always looked solemn and pained some shook their heads sadly and commented her luck is bad or this is news that makes you cry some even wept

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 when sabra and i approached the camp we heard drumming and saw faint lights shining through the threadbare tent where the women sat made of burlap sacks the tent had been pitched for cooking inside lit by kerosene lanterns suspended from the two center poles the flushed girls were on the ground crowded together in a circle sabra squeezed in next to the girl drumming on a round aluminum tray the beat was strong and the girls sang song after song these were short rhyming two part songs appropriate to the night of henna the evening before the wedding when women decorate their hands and feet with henna paste the girls took turns shouting out the first lines of new songs some of which welcomed the guests while others referred to the festivities themselves

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the freedom she wants for them and perhaps for herself is the subject of a popular song an early recording by awadh al maalky that includes a comical tale of woe the singer is moved he begins by the suffering that customs of the past have caused a young man hundreds of others have come to him to complain assuming the voice of the aggrieved young man the poet describes what happened in the three marriages his kin arranged for him when he reached out on the wedding night to touch his first bride he discovered she was completely bald the second bride though beautiful with long thick braids could not speak the third tried to strangle him in his sleep she was insane the young man declares he wont marry again unless he is allowed to choose his own bride resuming his own voice the singer comments on the young mans predicament with some advice to the elders MY WARNINGS ARE TO THE OLD MAN WHO IMPRISONS THE FREEDOM OF THE YOUNG WHO HAS FORGOTTEN A THING CALLED LOVE AFFECTION DESIRE BURNING FLAMES FORGOTTEN THE STRENGTH OF LOVERS FIRE THE FIRE OF LOVERS WHO LONG FOR ONE ANOTHER WHATS EXQUISITE IS THAT THEYRE AFRAID page 219 THEY SAY ANY MINUTE MY PRYING GUARD WILL TURN UP MY FATHERS ABOUT TO CATCH US

ETHNOGRAPHY:
 the chief and his few companions proceeded with confidence and next day killed and scalped a scieu whom they discovered robbing a rook's nest on the top of a tree highly satisfied with this success they thought it prudent to return home and though the cowardly asiniboiness had so shamefully deserted the common cause yet by virtue of his pretended prophesies he acquired equal honor with the chief in the success of the enterprise and a song was composed on the subject which is still in vogue amongst them consisting of these words KAKEGAMEG AND ASINIBOINESS HAVE SHOT AND SCALPED THE YELLOW SCIEUX all their songs are equally simple seldom exceeding a dozen of words but the air and manner of singing them is attended with a certain degree of mystery represented in hieroglyphical figures on bits of bark and never learned or explained to the vulgar without very considerable presents in return

 there is detailed knowledge of this from swedish lapland although our old writers never mention them separately tuderus has however written down the following finnish bearsong which apparently was sung to him by some lapp in lapp or in finnish 1 DEFEAT OF THE WOOD ANIMAL 2 BRINGS US GREAT HEALTH 3 A CATCH AGAINST THE STORAGE WALL 4 BRINGS THOUSANDS ALONG 5 GIVES A CATCH OF A HUNDRED 6 I CAME FROM THE GODS 7 WITH THE JOLLY CATCH 8 WHICH WITHOUT WONDERS TROUBLES 9 WAS GIVEN PAID 10 SINCE I COME HOME 11 I WILL MAKE MERRY THREE NIGHTS 12 MERRY I LEFT MERRY I RETURN 13 ACROSS VALLEYS MOUNTAINS HILLS 14 DRIVING THE DEVIL AHEAD 15 PLEASANT WAS THE DAY 16 THE DAY WILL STILL BE PLEASANT 17 I HONOR YOU OLD ONE 18 YEAR AFTER YEAR AS CATCH 19 NOT TO FORGET THE HYMN TO THE BEAR 20 I WILL COME BACK AGAIN the lapp origin of the hymn is proved by e g the word pertos lines 15 and 16 the lapp form of which means sweet pleasant the hymn contains the wish that the bear page 707 bring an abundance of game lines 4 and 5 the affirmation that the bear has something to do with the gods line 6 and the request that it drive away all evil forces ahead line 14 the singer intends to celebrate the killing for three days line 11 and he presents the bear song thinking that he will get a catch every year this bear poem differs altogether from equivalent finnish poems and may thus be lapp also from this point of view the person who presented the song to tuderus was by that time apparently assimilated into finnish life there were already at that time quite a lot of settlers in the region of the kitka and maanselk villages present day kuusamo and had adopted the kalevala type metric form of the finns tuderus worked up or rather interpreted the lapp poem or its adapted finnish translation in prose using also many forms characteristic of his native southwestern dialect
